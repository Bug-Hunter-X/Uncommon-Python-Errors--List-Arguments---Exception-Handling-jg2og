# Another uncommon error: forgetting to handle exceptions thoroughly
# This is less obvious, as it doesn't crash immediately
# but it can cause unexpected behavior further down the code

# Example

#Missing except block for TypeError exception which might occur if a and b are not numbers
# Missing return in except block will return None which may cause problems later in the flow

    try:
        result = a / b

#Note that the exception is not handled here and None is returned as the result of function

#This is just one example, and other similar errors can happen
#due to incorrect handling of exceptions or edge cases. 

#The main idea of this example is that it isn't necessarily a syntax error,
#but a logic error that is difficult to find and debug without careful testing and review.
